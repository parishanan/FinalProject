# FinalProject

## Project objective:


This project aims to;

i. Identifying the key abiotic factors that drive seagrass biomass fluctuations during the 2011 and 2019 flood events  

ii. Quantifying the cumulative concentration threshold for seagrass mortality due to the influence of flood plumes  

iii. Modelling the predicting biomass of seagrass under future conditions with increasing population and associated land-use change 


## Data
Data for this study was extracted from a platform called eReefs. eReefs is a collaborative project that aims to build a comprehensive coastal information system in Australia (eReefs 2021). This system contains data on remote sensing and water quality, catchment flow and water quality forecasting, hydrodynamic, sediment and water quality modeling, and operational hydrodynamic coastal ocean forecasting. It can be accessed here; https://ereefs.aims.gov.au/ereefs-aims

This project looked at the following variables;
- ammonia (NH4) 
- dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
- dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN)
- dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP)
- Dissolved Oxygen
- Dust
- light intensity above seagrass (EpiPAR_sg)
- mud carbonate
- mud mineral
- nitrate (NO3)
- pH
- secchi from 488nm
- total chlorophyll (Chl_a_sum) 
- Halophila nitrogen (SGH_N)

## Planned analysis
The analysis will involve the creation of;

+ Analysis of eagrass health over time 
+ Correlation matrices- to understand the interactions between the variables and the seagrass health/biomass
+ Comparative line graphs of isolated variables
+ Linear regression and predictive modelling of future runoff conditions
